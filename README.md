# Self-hosting Automation Catalog documentation (eng)
## Configuring Power Catalog (eng)

Follow the steps mentioned here to set up and administer a Power Catalog: [Administer the catalog - Power Platform | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/administer-catalog#set-up-the-catalog)

## Connecting Automation Catalog to Power Catalog (eng)

Add the URL of the required environment in environment variables in your ADO Pipeline or Github Workflow.

## Add Catalog Extension Metadata zip

Import the CatalogExtension_1_0_1_3.zip present in the repository, in the environment where the catalog is created.

## Adding A3P templates to Power Catalog (eng)

Install Pac cli. Use this documentation:  [Microsoft Power Platform CLI - Power Platform | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/cli/introduction?tabs=windows)

In the repository, Templates folder has all the Catalog items that need to be submitted in your target catalog.

In the Templates folder, each catalog item folder has a SubmissionDoc.json and a zip file.

Run update-submission-docs.ps1 – PowerShell script. Enter publisher ID, publisher name, Engineering contact details and support contact details when prompted while running the PowerShell script. This will update the above fields inside each SubmissionDoc json file.

Once the over script ran successfully, run submit-to-catalog-script.ps1 – PowerShell script. Enter the organization url. 

To get thorganization url - Go to power apps home page. Choose the environment where the catalog is created. Click on settings -> Developer resources. Copy the Web API endpoint base url.
